# Dijkstra-Route-Optimizer
  Dijkstra-Route-Optimizer is a project that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between major cities in India. It uses a graph data structure to represent cities and the distances between them. Users can input a starting city and a destination city, and the program will compute and display the shortest route and its total distance.
